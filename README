# Project Title

ETH 

## Description

This project contains codes solely for using Metacrafter tokens, These line of code is capable of burn, mint and balances functionalities.

## Getting Started

* To download this code I have made, please refer to "https://github.com/champagnesevy/metacrafter/blob/main/ETH"

### Executing program

For us to be able to execute this program,  we would need to start off with these line of codes:

  // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "SEV";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "ETH";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

Hence would follow these lines of codes as well in order for the program to run properly in "remix.ethereum.org"

  // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint (address _address, uint _value) public{
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances [_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn (address _address, uint _value) public{
        if (balances[_address] >=_value) {

        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances [_address] -= _value;
